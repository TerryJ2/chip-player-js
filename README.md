# Chip Player JS

Play online: [Chip Player JS](https://mmontag.github.io/chip-player-js)

Chip Player JS is a work in progress. Goals:

- Support popular game console formats and tracker formats (not exhaustive)
- Advanced sound control (channel volume, panning, etc.) like [NotSoFatso](https://disch.zophar.net/notsofatso.php)'s stereo and bandlimiting controls
- Built-in online music library like [Chipmachine](http://sasq64.github.io/chipmachine/)
- Simple music management (at least the ability to save favorites) like Winamp/Spotify

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

# Chip Player JS

Play online: [Chip Player JS](https://mmontag.github.io/chip-player-js)

Chip Player JS is a work in progress. Goals:

- Support popular game console formats and tracker formats (not exhaustive)
- Advanced sound control (channel volume, panning, etc.) like [NotSoFatso](https://disch.zophar.net/notsofatso.php)'s stereo and bandlimiting controls
- Built-in online music library like [Chipmachine](http://sasq64.github.io/chipmachine/)
- Simple music management (at least the ability to save favorites) like Winamp/Spotify
- High-quality MIDI playback with JS wavetable synthesis
    * Bonus: user-selectable soundbanks

### Development Notes

#### Architecture

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

The player engines come from C/C++ libraries such as [game-music-emu](https://bitbucket.org/mpyne/game-music-emu/wiki/Home) and [libxmp](https://github.com/cmatsuoka/libxmp), compiled to JS with [Emscripten](https://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site).

As more player engines are added, it seems the best way to combine them is probably to create a wrapper C project with one interface that gets exposed through Emscripten, rather than compiling several separate C/C++ libraries to JS and unifying their interfaces in the JS layer. This would make the bindings easier and reduce the overhead of running multiple Emscripten runtimes.

http://sasq64.github.io/chipmachine/

Chipmachine is a multiplatform player supporting an enormous number of formats. Downloads music from an impressive variety of [external sources](https://github.com/sasq64/chipmachine/blob/master/lua/db.lua).
Most of these come from HTTP sources without CORS headers, not feasible for direct playback.

#### MIDI Stuff

The best modern option for playing MIDI is probably using a well-designed GM SoundFont bank with a good SoundFont 2.01 implementation like FluidSynth.

This is a half assed attempt to replace Project64 with Mupen64plus, for a hoped better compatibility, and support for nicer recompiler cores for x86 and x86_64.

DONE:
* Get it working at all
* Verify old x86_64 recompiler works

TODO:

* Get old x86 recompiler converted and working
* Get new recompiler converted and working

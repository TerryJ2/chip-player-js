This is a half assed attempt to replace Project64 with Mupen64plus, for a hoped better compatibility, and support for nicer recompiler cores for x86 and x86_64.

DONE:
* Get it working at all
* Verify old x86_64 recompiler works
* Convert x86 recompiler

TODO:
* Get x86 recompiler working with MSVC 32 bit
* Get new recompiler converted and working

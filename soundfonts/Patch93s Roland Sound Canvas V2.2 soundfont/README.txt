For best results, it is strongly recommended you use the CoolSoft VirtualMIDISynth Windows driver. 
Coolsoft is free software, and  you do not need to pay for it. If you do not have Coolsoft, you 
can download it from this link:

Keep in mind this is not a perfect replica of the actual SC-55 Module's soundset. Many of the sounds are  not the same and because I could not find some of the original samples for them, I had to make 
them as close as possible by using special chorus effects and merging them with other sounds. 
Though it should sound close enough nonetheless.

Credit goes out to the people who made the soundfonts where I got some of the samples from. If it weren't for you guys, the creation of this soundfont would not be 
possible. Another special thanks goes to xan1242 for finding other samples and helping me make
instruments with them.

Thanks and enjoy!
